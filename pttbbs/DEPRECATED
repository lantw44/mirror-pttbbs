Thanks for using PTTBBS on OpenSVN.

Starting from 2010, OpenSVN has suspended its public service due to maintenance
issue. PTTBBS has stayed there longer but now we've decided to move to GitHub.
It was a tough decision, but that makes lots of things easier.

This PTTBBS repository on OpenSVN is now deprecated. No more new patches.
Please migrate to GitHub:

    https://github.com/ptt/pttbbs

If you want to stay with current version (on OpenSVN), edit mbbsd/Makefile and
delete the "deprecated" object.
